/**
 * Whether a metric may record `value`, once any default has been applied.
 *
 * Refuses rather than throws, for the reason `admitsSeries` gives: a metric
 * call runs inside the application's own code path. A NaN or an Infinity is
 * nearly always computed from the application's own data - a division by a
 * total that was zero, a value that failed to parse - so it turns up on
 * unlucky input in production rather than on every run. Recorded, it would
 * reach the collector as null, and a counter would stay NaN for the rest of
 * the process. The first refusal is logged, once per metric.
 *
 * Callers check it after their own argument checks, so a mistake in the
 * calling code - a missing label - still throws, on every run.
 *
 * Kept out of `counter.ts`, unlike `admitsSeries`: everything that module
 * exports is re-exported from the package root.
